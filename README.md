# AskSQL Project

## Description

This project is a chat bot designed for interacting with SQL codes. It allows users to ask questions to an AI, which can provide insightful responses based on the SQL codes set by the user. This project was created to simplify the process of querying databases and to make SQL more accessible to a wider audience.

## Technologies Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): A React framework for building JavaScript applications. It's known for its features like server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/): An open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): An open-source language which builds on JavaScript, one of the world’s most used tools, by adding static type definitions. Types provide a way to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation, and allowing TypeScript to validate that your code is working correctly.

## API Key Requirement

This project uses the OpenAI Chatbot for interacting with SQL codes. To run this project, you will need an API key from OpenAI. Without this key, the project will not work as expected. Please visit [OpenAI's website](https://www.openai.com/) to obtain an API key.

Remember to keep your API key secure and do not expose it in your code or version control system. It's recommended to use environment variables to handle API keys.

## Libraries Used

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/): A tool for transforming styles with JavaScript plugins. These plugins can lint your CSS, support variables and mixins, transpile future CSS syntax, inline images, and more.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML.
